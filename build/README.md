# build/

Unity WebGL files for the Unity panel. The `unity` service serves this folder at `http://localhost:8090/build/<file>`.

Empty by default. Either put your own build here (see "3D: Unity WebGL contract" in the root README), or run `make unity-demo` to download the demo scene (88 MB, kept out of git so clones stay small). The demo files are git-ignored by name, so give your own build a different name (e.g. `MineScene`) or it will not be committed.

# <Team name>: a digital mine on OpenEgiz

> Team Repository of the contest “Digital Mine on OpenEgiz”. **Replace the contents of this file with the instructions for your Submission.** The AI Jury runs the Submission strictly by these instructions, from scratch, in the Judge Environment. Accepted languages: English, Kazakh, Russian.

## Running

Requirements (Docker, `make`, Windows/WSL2 setup) are in [OPENEGIZ.md](OPENEGIZ.md) / [OPENEGIZ.ru.md](OPENEGIZ.ru.md).

```bash
sudo apt install -y make   # if make is missing (clean Ubuntu)
make up            # the OpenEgiz platform
make example-mine  # the Example Mine: twins, simulator, dashboard
```

Replace these commands with the commands of your Submission. The Submission must start by following these instructions without manual intervention (Rules, clause 6.4); downloading datasets and models and building are also listed here.
